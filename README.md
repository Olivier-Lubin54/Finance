# Finance
This was my solution to the Harvard CS50 Finance project in which a flask application using, SQL, HTML, and python was to be created. The application itself is able to register users and let them login to buy and sell mock stocks based on real data.
Include are also pages to review your account holdings and transaction history. The project had distribution code provide and an initial database that had one table. The application.py file includes majority of the completed work. Simple HTML templates were also created
alongisde a new SQL table.
